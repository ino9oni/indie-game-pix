# Issue: Victory Screen Hero Portrait Too Large

- **Summary**: Reduce the hero portrait size on the victory (picross-clear) screen so it matches the conversation portrait proportions and centers cleanly.
- **Context**: /tasklist `勝利モード時に表示される主人公の画像が大きすぎるので修正`
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Hero portrait width/height on picross-clear screen matches conversation mode framing (≈380x487 baseline, responsive downscaling on small screens).
  - Portrait remains vertically centered with surrounding glow/effect adjusted accordingly.
  - Layout aligns with existing victory card design without affecting other screens.
- **Owner**: Codex automation
- **Status**: Approved specification
